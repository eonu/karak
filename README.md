# شاي كَرَك

A strong Indian tea widely consumed in the Middle East (specifically in the Gulf regions of U.A.E, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain).

Many small cafeterias and restaurants run by South Asians tend to serve this tea in most areas of the U.A.E. But after asking around for recipes, most were unwilling to share their secrets.

So here's my recipe (with influence from a few YouTube videos).

---

**Serves one** - around 1.5 cups (360ml) of tea

## Equipment

- 1 small cooking pot
- 1 teacup (at least 1 + 1/2 cups or 360ml capacity)
- Measuring cups (1 and 1/2 cups) (not necessary if your teacup is exactly 1.5 cups)
- 2 tablespoons
- 1 teaspoon
- 1 small bowl (something like a condiment bowl) for holding spices and tea powder
- 1 sieve

## Ingredients

- Loose black tea (one teabag equivalent)

- 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger

- 1/4 teaspoon of ground cardamom (or one cardamom pod)

- 1/4 teaspoon of ground cinnamon

- 1 + 1/2 teaspoons of sugar

- 1 + 1/2 cups (360ml) of water

- 4 tablespoons of cardomom flavoured evaporated milk

  > I typically use [Rainbow milk](https://www.google.com/search?q=rainbow+evaporated+cardamom+milk), but this might not be available in other countries.
  >
  > If you can't get cardamom flavoured evaporated milk, you can substitute it for the same quantity of unflavoured evaporated milk and add more cardamom powder/pods.

### Optional

- 3 strands of saffron

## Method

- Combine the ground ginger, cinnamon and loose black tea in a small bowl.

  > - If using cardamom pods instead of the cardamom flavoured evaporated milk, add the cardamom pods here
  > - If using saffron, add the strands here

- Pour the water into the small cooking pot and set the burner to high heat, bringing the water to a boil.

- Pour the contents of the spice/tea bowl into the boiling water, stir with a tablespoon and leave it **for 1 minute**.

- Add the evaporated milk (with a new tablespoon) to the boiling tea and stir again, leaving it **for 1 minute**.

- Lower the heat, add the sugar and stir **for 30 seconds**.

- Repeat the following three times:

  - Increase the heat and allow the tea to start rising/bubbling
  - Lower the heat and allow the tea to stop rising/bubbling

- Turn off the burner, strain the tea and pour into the serving teacup.

## Suggestions

- Once opened (if canned), evaporated milk should be stored in a new container if being used again.

- If using saffron, make sure you use proper and good quality saffron. Don't buy American saffron, since this typically comes from the [safflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safflower) which is completely different to actual saffron.

  I strongly recommend Persian-grown saffron as this is normally the most pure and high quality.

- Drink while hot!
